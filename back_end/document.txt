Here's an all-too-common scenario: You buy shares of stock at $25 with the
intention of selling it if it reaches $30. The stock hits $30 and you decide to hold
out for a couple more gains. The stock reaches $32 and greed overcomes
rationality. Suddenly, the stock price drops back to $29. You tell yourself to just
wait until it hits $30 again. This never happens. You finally succumb to frustration
and sell at a loss when it hits $23.

In this scenario, it could be said that greed and emotion have overcome rational
judgment. The loss was $2 a share, but you actually might have made a profit of
7 when the stock hit its high.
