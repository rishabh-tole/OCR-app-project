Theoretically, the ability to make money on stocks involves two key decisions:
buying at the right time and selling at the right time. In order to make a profit, you
have to execute both of these decisions correctly. The return on any investment is.
first determined by the purchase price.

One could argue that a profit or loss is made at the moment it's purchased; the
buyer just doesn't know it until it's sold. However, while buying at the right price
may ultimately determine the profit gained, selling at the right price guarantees
the profit (if any). If you don't sell at the right time, the benefits of buying at the

right time disappear.

Many investors have trouble selling a stock, and sometimes the reason is rooted in
the innate human tendency toward greed. However, there are several strategies
that you can use to identify when itis (and when it isn't) a good time to sell. The
most important thing about these strategies is that they attempt to take some of
the human emotions out of the decision-making process.

KEY TAKEAWAYS.

* When it comes to investing, the decision of when to buy a stock can
sometimes be easier than knowing when is the appropriate time to sell a
stock.

* Ingeneral, there are three primary reasons for a long-term investor to sell:
the buy was a mistake, the price has risen dramatically, or the current
price is no longer supported by fundamentals.

* Emotion and human psychology can sometimes get in the way of making

a smart decision, so stay attuned to the data (and not your feelings)

There are generally three good reasons to sell a stock. First, buying the stock was a
mistake in the first place. Second, the stock price has risen dramatically. Finally,
the stock has reached a silly and unsustainable price. While there are many other
additional reasons for selling a stock, they may not be as wise of investment
decisions.
