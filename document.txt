Before you even think about heading to class, 
make sure that you’ve read (or at least skimmed) all 
pre-assigned reading from 
your professor. Even if you don’t have assigned reading, try and 
familiarize 
yourself with the topic before you get to class so you know what 
to expect.

A 2004 study by Spies and Wilkin found that the law students who 
were responsible 
for reading a legal case before they got to class displayed a 
greater 
understanding of the learning materials than students who were 
not expected to 
prepare before class.
Also don’t forget to pack all the things you need to learn 
effectively. Make sure 
you have multiple pencils (or some backup lead), a notebook, 
pens, highlighters, 
sticky notes, your textbook, and your laptop.
Don’t forget water! It’s tempting to bring coffee or some other 
form of caffeine 
to class. Try to stick to water and consume caffeine 
intelligently. While coffee 
doesn’t dehydrate you, and coffee in moderation certainly helps 
you focus and stay 
alert, caffeine dependency interferes with your quality of sleep 
and impairs 
mental function, ultimately impacting your ability to pay 
attention during class.
   Lastly, grab a snack before you head out the door for class. Avoid high-salt or 
high-sugar options, and aim for a “complete snack” that includes fat, protein, and 
carbs. Apples and peanut butter, crackers and cheese, or even certain power bars 
are good options. These snacks will leave you feeling full for longer, ensuring 
that you won’t be distracted by how much you want a burrito in the middle of your 
professor’s lecture about the structure of a cell.
